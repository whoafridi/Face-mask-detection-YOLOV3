  <p> Computer vision learning pay a high attention due to global pandemic COVID-19 to enhance public health service. During the fatality, tiny object detection is a more challenging task of computer vision, as it recruits the pair of classification and detection beneath of video illustration. Compared to other object detection deep neural networks demonstrated a helpful object detection with a superior achievement that is Face mask detection. However, accession with YOLOv3 covered by an exclusive topic which through certainly happening natural disease people get advantage. Added with face mask detection performed well by the YOLOv3 where it measures real time performance regarding a powerful GPU. whereas computation power with low memory YOLO darknet command sufficient for real time manner. Regarding the paper section below we have attained that people who wear face masks or not, its trained by the face mask image and non face mask image. Under the experimental conditions, real time video data that finalized over detection, localization and recognition. Experimental results that show average loss is 0.0730 after training 4000 epochs. After training 4000 epochs mAP score is 0.96. This unique approach of face mask visualization system attained noticeable output which has 96% classification and detection accuracy.
